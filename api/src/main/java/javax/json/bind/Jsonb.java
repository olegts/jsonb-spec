/**
 * <p>
 * {@code Jsonb} provides an abstraction over the JSON Binding framework operations:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@code fromJson}: read JSON input, unmarshal to Java objects content tree
 * <li>{@code toJson}: marshall Java objects content tree to JSON input
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * Instance of this class is created using {@link javax.json.bind.JsonbBuilder JsonbBuilder}
 * builder methods:
 * <pre>{@code
 * // Example 1 - Creating Jsonb using default JsonbBuilder instance provided by default JsonbProvider
 Jsonb jsonb = JsonbBuilder.create();

 // Example 2 - Creating Jsonb instance for a specific provider specified by a class name
 Jsonb jsonb = JsonbBuilder.newBuilder("foo.bar.ProviderImpl).build();

 // Example 3 - Creating Jsonb instance from a custom provider implementation
 Jsonb jsonb = new CustomJsonbBuilder().build();
 }</pre>
 *
 * <b>Unmarshalling (reading) from JSON</b><br>
 * <blockquote>
 * Unmarshalling can de-serialize JSON data that represents either an entire JSON
 * document or a subtree of a JSON document.
 * </blockquote>
 * <blockquote>
 * Reading (unmarshalling) object content tree from a File:<br><br>
 *    <pre>
 *     Jsonb jsonb = JsonbBuilder.create();
 *     Book book = jsonb.fromJson(new File("jsonfile.json"), Book.class);</pre>
 * If the unmarshal process is unable to unmarshal the JSON content to an object
 * content tree, fatal error is reported that terminates processing by
 * throwing JsonbException.
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Marshalling (writing) to JSON</b><br>
 * <blockquote>
 * <p>
 * Marshalling writes the representation of a Java object content tree into
 * JSON data.
 * </blockquote>
 * <blockquote>
 * Writing (marshalling) object content tree to a File:<br><br>
 *    <pre>
 *     jsonb.toJson(object, new File("foo.json");</pre>
 * Writing (marshalling) to a Writer:<br><br>
 *    <pre>
 *     jsonb.toJson(object, new PrintWriter(System.out));
 *    </pre>
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * <b>Encoding</b><br>
 * <blockquote>
 * In unmarshalling operations ({@code fromJson}), encoding of JSON data is detected automatically.
 * Use the {@link javax.json.bind.JsonbConfig JsonbConfig} API to configure expected
 * input encoding used within unmarshal operations. Client applications are
 * expected to supply a valid character encoding as defined in the
 * <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159">RFC 7159</a> and supported by Java Platform.
 *
 * In marshalling operations ({@code toJson}), UTF-8 encoding is used by default
 * for writing JSON data.
 * Use the {@link javax.json.bind.JsonbConfig JsonbConfig} API to configure the
 * output encoding used within marshal operations. Client applications are
 * expected to supply a valid character encoding as defined in the
 * <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159">RFC 7159</a> and supported by Java Platform.
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * For optimal use, {@code JsonbBuilder} and {@code Jsonb} instances should be
 * reused - for a typical use-case, only one {@code Jsonb} instance is
 * required by an application.
 *
 * <p> All the methods in this class are safe for use by multiple concurrent threads.
